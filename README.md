# **Deploying Your Project with AWS Amplify**

AWS Amplify is a powerful platform that makes it easy to build, deploy, and scale full-stack web and mobile applications. Whether you're hosting a static website, integrating a backend, or managing authentication, Amplify simplifies the entire process.

This guide walks you through deploying your project to AWS Amplify step by step.


---

## **Prerequisites**

Before we get started, make sure you have:

✔ An AWS Account – If you don’t have one, sign up at AWS.
✔ A Git Repository – Your project should be hosted on GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket.
✔ Node.js & NPM Installed – Required if you plan to use the Amplify CLI.
✔ Amplify CLI (Optional, but recommended) – If you want to manage the backend via terminal.

Step 1: Set Up AWS Amplify

1️⃣ Go to the AWS Console

Log in to the AWS Management Console and search for Amplify.

Click "Get Started" under "Host your web app".


2️⃣ Connect Your Repository

Select your Git provider (GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket).

Authenticate and choose your project repository and branch.


3️⃣ Configure Build Settings

AWS will auto-detect your framework (React, Vue, Angular, etc.).

If needed, modify the amplify.yml build settings.


4️⃣ Deploy Your Project

Click "Save and Deploy" and watch Amplify take care of everything!

Step 2: Configure Hosting & Permissions

🔒 By default, your app is private.

You can update access settings in the Amplify Console under "Access Control".

For a public website, set the app to "Public" or configure a custom domain.


🌍 Custom Domains

Want a professional URL? Go to Domain Management in Amplify.

Either buy a new domain or connect an existing one from Route 53.



---

Step 3: Deploy Using the Amplify CLI (Optional, for advanced users)

Prefer working from the terminal? The Amplify CLI lets you manage your app programmatically.

1. Install Amplify CLI

npm install -g @aws-amplify/cli

2. Configure AWS Credentials

amplify configure

Follow the on-screen prompts to create and link an IAM user.

3. Initialize Amplify in Your Project

amplify init

This sets up an Amplify environment within your repo.

4. Deploy Your Project

amplify publish

Boom! Your project is now live on AWS Amplify. 🎉


---

Step 4: Verify & Manage Your Deployment

🔎 Check the Deployment Status

Go to AWS Amplify Console and open your project.

You’ll see the deployment status and a live URL for your app.


🛠 Make Changes? No Problem!

Every time you push changes to your linked Git branch, Amplify automatically redeploys your app.

No need to manually redeploy unless using the CLI.

Additional Features & Considerations

🚀 Backend Integration

Need a database, authentication, or API? Use Amplify's backend services like:

Authentication (Amazon Cognito)

GraphQL & REST APIs (AWS AppSync & API Gateway)

Data Storage (DynamoDB, S3)



🔄 CI/CD Pipelines

Amplify automatically pulls the latest changes from your Git repository and redeploys your app.

You can set up branch-specific deployments (e.g., staging, production).


🔐 Security Best Practices

Configure IAM roles and permissions properly.

Enable encryption for stored data.

Use Amplify’s access control settings to restrict or allow user access.


📦 Storage & Performance

Choose an appropriate storage class for your needs (Standard, Intelligent-Tiering, etc.).

Enable CDN caching via AWS CloudFront to speed up content delivery.
